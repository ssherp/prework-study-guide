      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
        <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), to give the content structure</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>external CSS style sheetallows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
        <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
        <li>CSS box model is, Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content</li>
        <li>we combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
        <li>Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
        <li>DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase</li>
        <li>text-align. This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
        <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>

        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
        <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive</li>
        <li>In coding parlance, a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name</li>
        <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
        <li>string is contained within quotation marks</li>
        <li>each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
        <li>use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
        <li>the script.js file is linked within the body element</li>
        <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed</li>
        <li>using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>  
        <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
        <li>function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
        <li>To execute a function, we must call it in our code</li>
